# Games of Life
The goal of this repository is to compare various languages using Conway's Game of Life as a basis.

Game of Life provides simple rules, but affords us the opportunity to explore a language's features.
It:
- uses conditionals,
- uses iterables,
- manipulates string,
- manipualtes objects,
- includes cursory functional programming patterns,
- leverages `static` methods,
- works with pointers/borrowership/memory management,
- draws to console
